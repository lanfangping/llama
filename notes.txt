System: 
                    Classify the type of revision from the old paragraph to new paragraph. The old paragrapth starts with OLD PARAGRAPH and the new paragraph starts with NEW PARAGRAPH.

                    The categories of revisions:
                    1.1 Surface Changes
                        - Abbreviation, Spelling, Grammer, Punctuation
                    1.2 Style and Format
                        - Style, Format, Conventions
                    1.3 Word and Sentence-level Edits
                        - Rephrase, Paraphrase
                    1.4 Perspective and Tone
                        - Point of View, Vandalism, Counter Vandalism
                    2.1 Organizational Changes
                        - Refactoring, Relocation
                    3.1 Information Updates
                        - Fact Updates, Clarification, Disambiguation
                    3.2 Information Addition

                    3.3 Information Deletion
                        - Simplification, Concision
                    4.1 Citations and References
                        - Table/Figure Reference Changes,  Linking Changes
                    5. Others

                    Output all labels related to the revisions from OLD PARAGRAPH to NEW PARAGRAPH into an array. Example output: ['1.1', '3.1']
                    

User: 
                    OLD PARAGRAPH: Rather, it is the administrator's responsibility to make certain that all storage components ensure data integrity.

                    NEW PARAGRAPH: Rather, it is the administrator's responsibility to make certain that all storage components ensure integrity for both data and file-system metadata.
            

> Assistant:  Sure! Based on the categories of revisions you provided, I can classify the types of revisions made in the old paragraph to the new paragraph as follows:
Array of labels related to revisions: ['1.1', '3.1', '1.3', '4.1']
Explanation:
* '1.1' refers to Surface Changes, specifically spelling changes, as the old paragraph contains the word "ensure" with a single "e" and the new paragraph uses "ensure integrity" with two "e"s.
* '3.1' refers to Information Updates, specifically fact updates, as the new paragraph includes the phrase "file-system metadata" which was not present in the old paragraph.
* '1.3' refers to Word and Sentence-level Edits, specifically rephrasing, as the new paragraph uses different phrasing to convey the same meaning as the old paragraph.
* '4.1' refers to Citations and References, specifically linking changes, as the new paragraph includes a reference to a table or figure that was not present in the old paragraph.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
